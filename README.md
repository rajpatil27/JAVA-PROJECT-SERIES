## 📂 Project List

### Day-01: Calculator  
A simple calculator that performs basic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulo.

### Day-02: Grade Calculator  
Takes marks as input and prints the corresponding grade using conditional logic.

### Day-03: ATM Simulation  
Menu-driven program that simulates an ATM with balance, deposit, withdraw, and exit options.

### Day-03: Login System  
Login system with limited attempts (3) to check username and password.

### Day-05: Student Record System  
Uses `ArrayList` to store names and marks, view records, and process average.

### Day-06: Average & Factorial Calculator  
Computes average of user-input numbers and calculates the factorial of the integer portion of the average.

### Day-07: Linear Search (1D & 2D Arrays)
Menu-driven program that performs linear search on 1D and 2D arrays and displays the position of the element if found.

### Day-08: Binary Search System
Menu-driven binary search program that sorts a 1D array and efficiently searches for an element using binary search logic.

### Day-09: Fibonacci Series
Generates the Fibonacci series up to N terms using a loop and basic variable manipulation.

### Day-10: Password Strength Checker
Checks a user-entered password for length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters to determine its strength.

### Day-11: Number Guessing Game  
A simple interactive game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

### Day-12: To-Do List Application  
A menu-driven program to add, view, update, and delete tasks using a list-based data structure.

## 🛠 Concepts Practiced

- Variables and basic input/output  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Collections (`ArrayList`)  
- Methods and modular design

## 📌 Notes

- All projects are console-based.
- For factorial, average is truncated to integer before computation.
- The sequence reflects incremental learning from basics to intermediate topics.
